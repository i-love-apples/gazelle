    As a member of iAnon, you must read and understand the rules below. It will be taken that you have and understand, that there will be no re-dress for complaints later on. If you are still unsure of what a rule means, PLEASE ask your questions using the first line support, the iAnon Help Forum, or irc help<br />
    <br />
    Send a <a href="/staffpm.php">Staff PM</a> addressed to staff if other support has directed you to a moderator or if support has been unhelpful in your particular case. If you find any dead or broken links in the upload rules, send a <a href="/staffpm.php">Staff PM</a> addressed to staff, and include in your message the upload rule number (e.g. 2.1.5) and preferably the correct link to replace the broken one.<br />
    The uploading rules below are overwhelmingly long and detailed for a reason. The length is necessary to explain the rules clearly and thoroughly. A summary of each hi rule is in bold text before the actual rule for easier reading. You may also find the corresponding rule sections in the Index (top right of page) to help provide quick navigation.<br />
    <br />
    All upload categories must be something new or current within the last year. This especially applies to eBooks, tutorials and vendor mass produced graphics and audio stuff. This type of stuff is widely available usually and easy to find without a ratio hit. Keep uploads fresh unless something older was specifically requested. And if in doubt check with a <a href="/staffpm.php">Staff PM</a><br />

    <h3 id="_1860702552">1. Uploading Rules</h3><br />
    <h4 id="_2439338554">1.1. General</h4><br />
    <div class="box pad" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 20px"><br />
    <ul class="postlist"><li>1.1.1. <strong>Only MacOS</strong> Applications and Games, iOS Applications and Games, Graphics (stock-photos, stock-videos, clipart, 3d-models, icons, fonts, web-templates, plugins, effects, etc.), Audio (iTunes LPs, samples, loops, plugins, effects, score), Tutorials (eLearning videos), Other (ebooks, audiobooks, magazines and miscellaneous content) are allowed on the site.</li><li>You must have legal rights to the file you are uploading. Iâ€™m</li><li>You may not use this site to distribute any material which you do not have the legal rights to.</li><li>1.1.2. Duplicate torrents in any category are not allowed. Different language editions of the same application and version are unique and are not considered dupes.</li><li>1.1.3. Seed complete copies of your uploads. Do not upload a torrent unless you intend to seed until there are at least 1.0 distributed copies. Seeding past this minimum is strongly encouraged.</li><li>1.1.4. No advertising or personal credits (examples youtube/telegram/social channels). Do not advertise other sites or groups in torrent descriptions, torrent directories, torrent file names, or torrent contents. Providing developer, or retailer information is not considered advertising.</li><li>1.1.5. You cannot request a bounty for an upload!</li></ul><br />
    </div><br />
    <h4 id="_3417699407">1.2. Specifically Banned</h4><br />
    <div class="box pad" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 20px"><br />
    <ul class="postlist"><li>1.2.1. Spam, advertising links in torrent contents or descriptions.</li><li>Your upload must not have external links, built-in links or any references to other trackers/sites/groups. You must remove ALL links and advertising from source prior to uploading (e.g., folder names, file names, nfo, text file or dmg background). This includes ANY mention of our site. Apps with links being built into the 'Help' menu in applications or games are also not allowed to be uploaded.</li><li>Uploading these will result in a warning and a temporary loss of uploading privileges. For more detail, here is a thread regarding <a href="/forums.php?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=48"><span style="color: blue;">Banned Uploads</span></a></li><li>Also see: <a href="/forums.php?action=viewthread&amp;threadid=42"><span style="color: blue;">Poorly Packaged Uploads</span></a></li><li>Exceptions: scene, cracker credits may be included in a lineage text file, in a folder name (e.g. "comment" or "cracked by ?"), but nothing else.</li><li>1.2.2. Pornographic Content are not allowed.</li><li>1.2.3. 0-day packs are not allowed. Groups often release 0-Day packs of major titles on a weekly basis, but these packs do not have a useful lifespan on a torrent site like iAnon, and they are unnecessarily large in file size.</li><li>1.2.4. TV Shows, Movies, and Documentaries are not allowed. Except for rare cases at the discretion of the Staff.</li><li>1.2.5. Pre-Release content including Alpha, Beta, Preview and Apple Developer releases are not allowed. Except for rare cases at the discretion of the Staff. You need to request approval via the <a href="/staff.php"><span style="color: blue;">Staff PM</span></a> prior to uploading, not doing so may result in a warning or worse.</li><li>1.2.6. User compilations in any category. All releases, packs, or collections must be reasonably official as specified in each category.</li><li>1.2.7. DRM-restricted files. Do not upload files containing DRM, as they will be unreadable by anyone who downloads them.</li><li>1.2.8. Charity event bundles or once in a life-time bundles. For example, Humble Bundle charity events need to end before they are allowed to be uploaded. Another example are the 5DayDeal bundles that would need to end before being allowed to upload. If in doubt you can ask using a <a href="/staffpm.php">Staff PM</a></li></ul><br />
    </div><br />
    <h4 id="_715784672">1.3. Did you check your contents?</h4><br />
    <div class="box pad" style="padding: 10px 10px 10px 20px"><br />

All uploads must include a detailed description and adhere to the correct requirements, as listed in each category.</li><li>1.3.5. You may give credit to the release group (optional).

    <span style="font-style: italic;">MacOS Apps allow grouping of multiple App versions, referred to as Releases. You can add a new version to an existing by using the Add Version button from the torrent group's description.

    <ul class="postlist"><li>2.1.1. Bundling of Apps and a Keygen/SN/Patch-K as a single archive. If you have a Keygen/SN/Patch-K which sits separately to the application, it MUST be kept separate in a folder.</li><li>2.1.2.2. Collections of cracks, keygens or serials are not allowed. The crack, keygen or serial for an application must be in a torrent with its corresponding application. It cannot be uploaded separately from the application.

If you wish to upload a standalone keygen or crack, you must check with staff (via the <a href="/staffpm.php">Staff PM</a>) before you upload!</li><li>2.1.3. Release descriptions must contain detailed information about the application. When creating or editing an Application group, please follow this template:</li></ul><br />

If a torrent is already present on the site in a version you wanted to upload, you are not allowed to upload it.</li><li>2.2.2. A developer release torrent may coexist with an App Store release torrent of the same application version. If both a developer release and an App Store release are uploaded of the same application and version, both may stay on the site. Any subsequent uploads of the same torrent in either form (with identical install methods) are dupes.</li><li>2.2.3. Different language editions of the same application and version are unique. Multi-language versions and single language versions of different languages are not considered dupes.</li><li>2.2.4. Existing application torrents can be trumped by other torrents with better install methods. Releases of an application with a serial key may be trumped by a release of the same version number that includes a patch or keygen. Releases with a patch may be trumped by a release of the same version number with a keygen. A release containing a pre-cracked application may coexist with a release of the same version number that includes any of the other activation methods. Report the older torrent when you are trumping it with a torrent of the same application containing an improved method of installation.</li><li>2.2.5. Applications that no longer work will be deleted when reported. If the install method for an application no longer works (e.g., the serial key has been blacklisted and doesn't work for the included version, the install method is no longer supported, etc.) the torrent will be removed.</li><li>2.2.6. Report all trumped and duplicated torrents. If you trump a torrent or notice a duplicate torrent, please use the report link (RP) to notify staff for removal of the old or duplicate torrent. If you are uploading a superior torrent to the current one of the same version on the site, report the older torrent and include a link to your torrent in the report. Your torrent will be deleted as a dupe if the older torrent is not reported.</li></ul><br />
